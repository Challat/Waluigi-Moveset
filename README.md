# Waluigi-Moveset
Waluigi Moveset for SSBU

THIS MOD IS FOR SMASHLINE 2- if you still use smashline 1 you will need to update.

Thank you for sticking with me through this long process. I want to thank alot of the members of the SSBU modding discord for helping me with alot of coding things that I knew nothing about.

Plugin.NRO stays where it is.
libthe_csk_collection.nro goes in the atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\romfs\skyline\plugins folder.
