# Waluigi-Moveset
Waluigi Moveset for SSBU
Thank you for sticking with me through this long process. I want to thank alot of the members of the SSBU modding discord for helping me with alot of coding things that I knew nothing about.

There are a few things that will make this mod crash. The plugin used for Waluigis "character Slot" IS NOT COMPATIBLE  with prcx or prcxml files.
If the mod crashes try a clean install. Add Waluigi first then add your mods back. If you are using a nintendo switch you can use the mod manager ingame 
to create a workspace with only the waluigi mod enabled.

Plugin.NRO stays where it is.
libcss_slot_redirection.NRO goes in the atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\romfs\skyline\plugins folder. Ic can also be chainloaded (for those who know what that is.)
